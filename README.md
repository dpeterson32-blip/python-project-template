# Python Project Template for Beginners

Welcome! This is a simple Python project template designed to help you get started with Python programming.

## What's in This Project?

This project contains a basic Python program that prints "Hello World" to the screen. It's the perfect starting point for learning Python!

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Open the Project

You already have this project open in VS Code. The main file is `main.py`.

### Step 2: Run the Program

To run your Python program, follow these steps:

1. **Using VS Code**: 
   - Open the `main.py` file
   - Click the **Run** button (▶️) in the top right corner of the editor
   - Watch the output appear at the bottom of the screen

2. **Using the Terminal**:
   - Open the terminal (View → Terminal, or press Ctrl+`)
   - Type the command: `python3 main.py`
   - Press Enter to run the program

### Step 3: See the Output

You should see the message:
```
Hello World
```

## How to Customize

Ready to make changes? Try these experiments:

1. **Change the message**: 
   - Open `main.py`
   - Replace `"Hello World"` with your own message
   - Example: `print("My name is Sarah")`

2. **Print multiple lines**:
   - Add more `print()` statements
   - Example:
     ```python
     print("Hello World")
     print("I'm learning Python!")
     print("This is fun!")
     ```

3. **Do some math**:
   - Try these commands inside `print()`:
     ```python
     print(5 + 3)
     print(10 - 2)
     print(4 * 5)
     ```

## Common Commands for Beginners

Here are some useful Python basics to try:

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `print()` | Display text or values | `print("Hello")` |
| `+` | Add numbers | `print(2 + 3)` |
| `-` | Subtract numbers | `print(10 - 4)` |
| `*` | Multiply numbers | `print(3 * 7)` |
| `/` | Divide numbers | `print(20 / 4)` |

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, try:

- Creating **variables** to store information
- Using **input()** to get text from the user
- Writing **if statements** to make decisions
- Using **loops** to repeat actions
- Creating **functions** to organize your code

## Tips for Success

✅ **Run your code often** - Test changes as you make them  
✅ **Start small** - Write one line, test it, then add more  
✅ **Read error messages** - They tell you what went wrong  
✅ **Experiment** - Try new things and see what happens  
✅ **Ask questions** - Reach out to your instructor if you get stuck
